			<h2 style="text-align: left">MEET NEW PEOPLE</h2>
			<p style="text-align: left">The Washington State University campus in Pullman has around 20,000 students, which means your chance of meeting someone with common interests is pretty high. But, going out into the community and building friendships with those people can also be a little daunting. Here are some ways to help you get out there and meet some fellow Cougs.</p>
			<p style="text-align: left">There are 400+ student-led organizations at WSU, <a href="http://studentinvolvement.wsu.edu/?utm_source=sts&amp;utm_medium=undefined&amp;utm_campaign=undefined&amp;utm_term=undefined&amp;utm_content=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here</a> to browse for one you might like.</p>

			<h4><img loading="lazy" class="left-hand-icons alignleft wp-image-116" src="https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/590/2015/05/ShowUp.png" alt="ShowUp2" width="100" height="100" /></h4>
			<h4>Show up.</h4>
			<p>It sounds simple, but you have to put yourself out there to meet people. You won’t meet people sitting alone at home, or even picking your own table at the CUB.  Ask to share a table if it will start a conversation. Put yourself in situations where you see the same people over and over, like coffee shops or study spots. Casual acquaintances or neighbors can become more significant relationships. Keep in mind though, it’s okay to attend <a href="https://calendar.wsu.edu/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">events</a> alone—it may encourage you to try and find someone to talk to.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h4><img loading="lazy" class="left-hand-icons alignleft wp-image-119" src="https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/590/2015/05/Group.png" alt="Group&quot;" width="100" height="100" /></h4>
			<h4>Join a group.</h4>
			<p>Rather than finding people and hoping you have something in common, find something you love and meet people there. WSU has tons of <a href="https://wsu.presence.io/">student organizations</a> centered on hobbies, cultures, faith, academia, art, and more. It also provides a specific time to socialize, which can be nice with a busy schedule.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h4><img loading="lazy" class="left-hand-icons alignleft wp-image-121" src="https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/590/2015/05/BeNice.png" alt="Nice" width="100" height="100" /></h4>
			<h4>Be nice.</h4>
			<p>It’s true in kindergarten and it’s true in college. Not only is it important to be nice to the people you are talking to, but be mindful about what you say about other people. Gossip is not a positive way to make friends and can actually create distance in all your relationships.</p>

			<h4>Make friendship goals.</h4>
			<p>It may sound analytical when we are talking about relationships, but if you head into a party with a goal to talk to at least three new people or find at least one person in each class you can study with, then you are more likely to put yourself out there.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h4><img loading="lazy" class="left-hand-icons alignleft wp-image-120" src="https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/590/2015/05/Expectations.png" alt="Expectation" width="100" height="100" /></h4>
			<h4>Real expectations and misses.</h4>
			<p>Not every attempt at a relationship will work. Don’t take it personally. Sometimes it just doesn’t work out and you have to keep trying. And when you do make friends, don’t worry about the “best friend” status. Just focus on what you have common, how much time you like to spend with each person, and how you positively contribute to each other’s lives.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h4><img loading="lazy" class="left-hand-icons alignleft wp-image-122" src="https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/590/2015/05/Slow.png" alt="Slow" width="100" height="100" /></h4>
			<h4>Take things slowly.</h4>
			<p>Remember that friendships and relationships take time and it may take a while to find a new best friend or even someone you can regularly spend time with.</p>
