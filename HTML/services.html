			<h3>Campus and Community Involvement</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Getting involved may seem like the last thing you should do if you are looking to improve your grades or find time to do other things.  But decades of research and thousands of personal stories attest to the idea that students involved in activities outside the classroom are more successful.</p>
			<p>Whether it is because of the support you receive from others through these activities, the structure they create in your schedule that leads to better time management, or because you just feel good about your college experience, getting involved can get you to graduation.</p>
			<p>The campus and community organizations listed below are only a few of the resources available to you. These organizations offer mentoring, academic resources, programs for personal development, and much more.</p>
			<h4><a href="http://cce.wsu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center for Civic Engagement</a></h4>
