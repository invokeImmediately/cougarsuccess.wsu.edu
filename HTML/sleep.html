			<h2>Sleep</h2>
			<p>Sleep is one of the most important aspects of well being. Multiple studies have shown that college students are the most sleep deprived segment of the population. Adequate sleep allows us to focus, make good decision, and consolidate the information we learn during the day. Sleep is essential to being able to move the information into storage. Spreading out your studying time and sleep allows for better integration of information and will help you feel more prepared.</p>

			<h4>Sleep deprivation can lead to serious health problems:</h4>
			<p>According to some estimates, 90% of people with insomnia have increased risk of another health condition such as: heart disease, heart attack and heart failure, irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, stroke, and diabetes.</p>
			<h4>Sleep loss makes learning difficult:</h4>
			<p>Lack of sleep impairs attention, alertness, concentration, reasoning, and problem solving.</p>
			<h4>Sleepiness makes you forgetful:</h4>
			<p>Various sleep cycles play a role in saving memories in the mind during the night. If you don’t get enough sleep, you won’t be able to remember what you learned and experienced during the day.</p>
			<h4>Lack of sleep impairs judgment:</h4>
			<p>Lack of sleep can affect our ability to assess situations accurately, make sound judgments, and act on them wisely.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column two ">
			<h4>Sleepiness causes accidents:</h4>
			<p>Lack of sleep is a major public safety hazard. Drowsiness can slow reaction time as much as driving drunk.</p>
			<h4>Sleepiness is depressing:</h4>
			<p>Over time, lack of sleep and sleep disorders can contribute to symptoms of depression. People diagnosed with depression or anxiety are more likely to sleep less than six hours at night.</p>
			<h4>Lack of sleep kills sex drive:</h4>
			<p>Sleep specialists say that sleep-deprived men and women report less interest in sex. Depleted energy, sleepiness, and increased tension may be largely to blame.</p>
