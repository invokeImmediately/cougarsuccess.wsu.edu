			<p>Are you interested in raising your Grade Point Average?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The fastest way to improve your GPA is to retake courses you earned a C- or lower in. See <a href="http://catalog.wsu.edu/Pullman/AcademicRegulations/ListBy/34">Academic Regulation 34</a> for more information.</li>
				<li>Attend your classes. Skipping class means you&#8217;re missing important material necessary to succeed. If you know you have to miss a class, be sure you contact your instructor ahead of time.</li>
				<li>Setup a meeting with an <a href="http://ascc.wsu.edu/academic-services/academic-success-coaching/">Academic Success Coach</a>. In your meeting, you’ll learn more about time management, note taking, exam preparation, reading strategies, study strategies, and more.</li>
				<li>Take advantage of <a href="http://cougarsuccess.wsu.edu/tutoring-resources/">tutoring</a>. Tutors are an excellent resource for students and in most cases, they&#8217;re free. More often than not, tutors have previously taken the course and have done well enough to tutor others. Even if you don&#8217;t have specific questions, working on your homework with the help of a tutor will help you get past unexpected roadblocks.</li>
				<li>Try not to overload yourself. A course load of 15-16 credits is recommended for most students. Be sure to speak with your <a href="http://cougarsuccess.wsu.edu/find-an-advisor/">academic advisor</a> if you have questions about a specific class or your course load.</li>
				<li>If you&#8217;re struggling in a course and exhausted all other options, talk to your <a href="http://cougarsuccess.wsu.edu/find-an-advisor/">academic advisor</a> about dropping or withdrawing from the course. If you need to drop a course, keep in mind it could impact your graduation date, financial aid, athletic requirements, and more.</li>
