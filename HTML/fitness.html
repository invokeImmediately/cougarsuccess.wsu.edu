			<h2 style="text-align: left">Fitness</h2>
			<p style="text-align: left">A lot of habits change when you come to college. You have new sleep patterns, new food choices, and new levels of activity and all of these play a role in your physical health.</p>
			<p style="text-align: left">Staying active and getting regular exercise not only help you feel better physically, it helps you stay mentally and emotionally healthy too. Think about different ways you can incorporate physical activity into your new schedule.</p>

			<p>Along with traditional methods of exercise like cardio and weight training, University Recreation also provides fitness classes, outdoor adventures, climbing, and many other ways to stay fit and have fun.</p>
			<h4><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-249" src="https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/590/2015/05/Stretch.png" alt="Stretch" width="100" height="100" />Stretch it out</h4>
			<p>Avoid injuries by stretching each time you exercise. Simple stretches before and after you work out or engage in physical activity can help keep you active and pain free. It’s also important to stretch when you study. Make sure to take breaks to move your body.</p>
			<h4><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-245" src="https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/590/2015/05/Bike.png" alt="bike" width="100" height="100" />Ride your bike</h4>
			<p>Instead of taking the bus or driving to class, try biking instead. It will give you a few minutes of exercise between your classes. If you don’t have a bike, check out the Green Bike program for access to free bikes all over campus.</p>

			<p>One way to get some exercise is to make it a game. Play a sport. Join an intramural team or just get some friends together to play pickup games.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h4><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-250" src="https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/590/2015/05/Wal.png" alt="Walk" width="100" height="100" />Walk to class</h4>
			<p>While taking public transportation might be quicker, walking will give you a chance to stretch your legs, burn some calories, and relax before your next class. The Palouse hills are a good workout any day.</p>
			<h4><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-246" src="https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/590/2015/05/Buddy.png" alt="Buddy" width="100" height="100" />Find a buddy</h4>
			<p>With someone else relying on your showing up, you’ll be much more likely to make the effort to work out. Plus, working out with a friend can be a great way to make fitness more fun.</p>
