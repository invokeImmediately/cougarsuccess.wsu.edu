			<h2 style="text-align: left">Stress less</h2>
			<p style="text-align: left">Stress is a part of everyone’s lives and can negatively affect your health if it is not managed appropriately. Stress is the largest obstacle to academic success and is often brought on by external events such as relationships, family, classwork, or finances. How you react and manage your stress influences how much of an impact it has on your daily life.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Any number of these symptoms may affect your ability to hang out with friends, focus at work, or do well in school. The important thing is to know how to effectively manage your stress. Some will turn to negative coping strategies like alcohol and drug use or working too much. Think about how you manage stress and what you can do to help minimize negative impacts to your life.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h4>Talk it out:</h4>
			<p>Stress can sometimes make us isolate ourselves from others, even though staying connected and having someone to talk to can help significantly.</p>
			<h4>Ask for help:</h4>
			<p>Sometimes asking for more information, deadline extensions, or even getting roommates to help out with tasks at home can relieve stress. If you are in distress, the <a href="https://studentcare.wsu.edu/">Student Care Network</a> is available for all WSU students and there are <a href="https://studentcare.wsu.edu/faculty-staff-resources/helping-students-in-distress/">resources available</a> to help, no matter where you&#8217;re located.</p>
