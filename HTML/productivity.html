			<h3>Tips on Productivity</h3>
			<h4>Eliminate interruptions</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Dedicate chunks of time to do your important tasks.</li>
				<li>Identify potential interruptions and eliminate them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Examples could be turning off your phone or putting a &#8220;Do Not Disturb&#8221; sign on your door.</p>
			<h4>Get organized</h4>
			<p>Keep yourself organized throughout the semester. You&#8217;ll save a lot of time if you don&#8217;t have to go searching for your notes or find a file on your computer.</p>
			<h4>Plan your day in advance</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>It takes 10-12 minutes for you to plan out your day and this small investment of time will save you up to two hours in wasted time throughout the day.</li>
				<li>Get one major thing done before you start your day. This will increase your daily productivity level and it will give you a feeling of accomplishment to begin the day with.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Turn off the internet</h4>
			<p>The Internet is helping you procrastinate. If you have to use the internet for your work, use apps/websites to help you block distracting websites.</p>
			<h4>Stop multitasking on important tasks</h4>
			<p>Multitasking is more like task-switching, where we move constantly from one open task to another, and back, and back again. Jumping around like this results in more errors than if we simply worked on a single task, without interruption, to completion.</p>
			<p>In fact, the act of constantly switching back and forth can reduce our overall productivity by 40%. In other words, when we multitask we’re not faster — we’re slower!</p>
