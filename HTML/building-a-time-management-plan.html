			<p>1. Get a planner. It can be paper or electronic, whichever works for you, but it should be portable.</p>
			<p>2. Make a list of all of your commitments and note which ones you have control over. Your commitments could include classes, work, club meetings, working out, eating, and studying.</p>
			<p>3. Lay our your commitments from highest to lowest priority. Remember, you only have 168 hours per week to work with and you have to sleep sometime.</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 30px">a. High priority commitments are events that <em>must </em>happen on a certain day at a specific time, like class or work.</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 30px">b. Medium priority commitments are things that happen on a certain day, but have variable times and can be worked in around higher priority things. Medium priority things might include studying, eating, and exercising.</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 30px">c. Low priority commitments are things that can be put-off until the higher priority things are done, like volunteering, intramural sports, and social time with friends.</p>
			<p>4. Take your planner with you and as you complete your commitments, check them off. You&#8217;ll feel a great sense of accomplishment.</p>
			<p>5. Carry your planner with you throughout your day and check things off as you finish them. You&#8217;ll feel very accomplished when you see your checked off list at the end of the day.</p>
