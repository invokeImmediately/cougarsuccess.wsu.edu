			<h2>Time management overview</h2>
			<p>Time management is a skill everyone needs. As a college student, time management is essential for your success. Unlike high school where teachers frequently structured your assignments and your day was full of classes, in college you will have less in-class time, more outside of class work, and a great deal of freedom and flexibility.</p>
			<p>These tips provide you with strategies for managing your time well so you can get the most out of your WSU experience. In order to begin managing your time effectively, you must set out some clear goals and create a personalized and flexible schedule.</p>

			<h3>Use your time wisely</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h4>Create a daily plan:</h4>
			<p>Plan your day in the morning or the evening before. The plan gives you a good overview of how your day will go so you won&#8217;t be caught off guard.</p>
			<h4>Give a time limit to each task:</h4>
			<p>Be clear that you need to finish certain tasks by a specific time. This prevents your work from eating into your time reserved for other activities.</p>
			<h4>Use a calendar:</h4>
			<p>Using a mobile calendar gives you access to your schedule no matter where you are.</p>
			<h4>Be early:</h4>
			<p>When you aim to be on time, you’ll either be on time or late. If you aim to be early, you’ll most likely be on time or have some time to spare. Always strive to be early to appointments or for deadlines.</p>
			<h4>Eliminate time wasters:</h4>
			<p>Facebook, Twitter and email checking takes time away from your work. Check in less often to be more productive during work time.</p>
			<h4>Leave some buffer time:</h4>
			<p>Don’t pack everything so close together. Leave a 5-10 minute break in between each task.</p>
			<h4>Plan rewards:</h4>
			<p>Reward yourself after something has been achieved or as a well-earned break from a task. The more you reward yourself for small achievements, the less you will feel like you are missing out or being deprived and you will procrastinate less.</p>

			<h3>Top tips for time management</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Find something to enjoy in whatever you do. Even if it isn’t ‘fun’, think about how it contributes to your goals.</li>
				<li>Remind yourself: &#8220;There is always enough time for the important things.” If it is important, you should be able to make time to do it.</li>
				<li>Examine your old, time-wasting habits and search for ways to change or eliminate them.</li>
				<li>Keep paper or a calendar with you to jot down the things you have to do or notes to yourself.</li>
				<li>Look ahead in your month and try to anticipate what is going to happen so you can better schedule your time.</li>
				<li>Try rewarding yourself when you get things done as you had planned, especially the important ones.</li>
				<li>When you catch yourself procrastinating—ask yourself, “What am I avoiding?”</li>
				<li>Start with the most difficult parts of projects.</li>
				<li>Concentrate on one thing at a time.</li>
				<li>Think on paper when possible—it makes it easier to review and revise.</li>
				<li>Be sure and set deadlines for yourself whenever possible.</li>
				<li>Delegate responsibilities whenever possible.</li>
				<li>Ask for advice when needed.</li>
