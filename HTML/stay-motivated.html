			<h2 style="text-align: left">Stay motivated</h2>
			<p style="text-align: left">Motivation is the crucial element in setting and attaining goals. Discovering what motivates you and taking control of your own goals can make the difference between a productive day and a day spent in bed.</p>
			<p style="text-align: left">Before you make goals, give yourself a pep talk, and get to work, think about what motivates you and how that affects your goals.</p>

			<h4 style="text-align: center">Extrinsic motivation</h4>
			<p style="text-align: center">Extrinsic motivation occurs when you are motivated to do something in order to earn a reward or avoid a punishment. Examples of behaviors that are the result of extrinsic motivation include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Studying to get a good grade</li>
				<li>Cleaning your room to avoid being reprimanded by your parents</li>
				<li>Participating in a sport to win awards</li>
				<li>Competing in a contest to win a scholarship</li>

			<h4 style="text-align: center">Intrinsic motivation</h4>
			<p style="text-align: center">Intrinsic motivation means doing something because it is personally rewarding. You perform an activity for its own sake rather than the desire for some external reward. Examples of behaviors that are the result of intrinsic motivation include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Participating in a sport because you find the activity enjoyable</li>
				<li>Solving a word puzzle because you find the challenge fun and interesting</li>
				<li>Playing a game because you find it exciting</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Motivation can be difficult to find when there are tasks we don’t see a benefit to, which is why goals are important. Often times small tasks like studying, cleaning, and keeping in touch with friends are meeting a larger goal. Take the time to lay out your goals, write them down, make them <a href="http://cougarsuccess.wsu.edu/goal-making/">S.M.A.R.T.</a>, and share them with a friend.</p>
